# Changelog

This changelog starts with the migration to the standalone `m-charts` repository.
Future entries should document changes made after the initial commit.

## Initial Migration

### Required Compatibility Changes

- Reusable chart source now lives under `packages/m-charts/src`.
- Shared plot-engine imports moved from the previous direct source layout to:

  ```text
  packages/m-charts/src/plot-engine
  ```

- Scatter imports moved to:

  ```text
  packages/m-charts/src/m-scatter
  ```

- Histogram imports moved to:

  ```text
  packages/m-charts/src/m-histogram
  ```

- Parallel-coordinate imports moved to:

  ```text
  packages/m-charts/src/m-parallel
  ```

- Demo-only application code, routes, generated-data loaders, URL state, theme
  state, panels, and CSS now live under `apps/demo`.
- Demo route paths changed to the `m-*` names:

  ```text
  /m-scatter
  /m-parallel
  /m-histogram
  ```

- Source-copy integrations should copy the needed `packages/m-charts/src`
  folders into the host application and rewrite imports to local copied module
  paths.
- `m-charts` is not published to npm yet, so `npm install m-charts` is not a
  supported consumer path.

### Preserved Compatibility

- The chart engines preserve the public command, event, update, binding, and
  dispose lifecycle shape as far as possible.
- Local workspace imports are available for the intended package boundary:

  ```ts
  import { createEmitter } from 'm-charts/plot-engine';
  import { createScatterPlot } from 'm-charts/m-scatter';
  import { createHistogramPlot } from 'm-charts/m-histogram';
  import { createParallelPlot } from 'm-charts/m-parallel';
  ```

- Compatibility aliases are available inside the workspace for older package
  import names:

  ```ts
  import { createScatterPlot } from 'm-charts/scatter';
  import { createHistogramPlot } from 'm-charts/histogram';
  import { createParallelPlot } from 'm-charts/parallel';
  ```

### Validation

Use the current repository commands after migrating imports:

```sh
pnpm typecheck
pnpm lint
pnpm test:unit
pnpm test:e2e
pnpm build
```
